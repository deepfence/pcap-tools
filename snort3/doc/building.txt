The options listed below must be explicitly enabled so they are built
into the Snort binary.  For a full list of build options, run ./configure
--help.

*  *--enable-shell*: enable building local and remote command line shell
   support.

* *--enable-tsc-clock*: use the TSC register on x86 systems for improved
  performance of latency and profiler features.

These options are built only if the required libraries and headers are
present.  There is no need to explicitly enable.

* *flatbuffers*: for an alternative perf_monitor logging format.

* *hyperscan* >= 4.4.0: for the regex and sd_pattern rule options and the hyperscan
  search engine.

* *iconv*: for converting UTF16-LE filenames to UTF8 (usually included in glibc)

* *libunwind*: for printing a backtrace when a fatal signal is received.

* *lzma*: for decompression of SWF and PDF files.

* *safec*: for additional runtime error checking of some memory copy operations.

If you need to use headers and/or libraries in non-standard locations, you
can use these options:

* *--with-pkg-includes*: specify the directory containing the package
  headers.

* *--with-pkg-libraries*: specify the directory containing the package
  libraries.

These can be used for pcap, luajit, pcre, dnet, daq, lzma, openssl,
flatbuffers, iconv, and hyperscan packages.  For more information on
these libraries see the Getting Started section of the manual.
