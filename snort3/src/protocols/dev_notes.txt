Headers for the various protocols processed by Snort.  Use these headers
instead of directly accessing system headers.  Advantages:

* the vagaries of required system includes are minimized and localized here

* these headers are OO in nature and much more user friendly than the often
  awkard system defined structs

Packet, used throughout Snort, is defined here as well.  Packet represents
a unit of work, essentially a buffer associated with a flow.  It does not
necessarily represent a wire packet.

* PktType indicates the general nature of the packet.  This may be the
  transport protocol for wire packets, FILE for file data, or PDU for a
  reassembled buffer.

* proto_bits indicates the protocols present in the packet.

Protocol Types:

* IpProtocol represents the standard protocol numbers as defined by IANA.

* ProtocolId is a superset of IpProtocol that also includes ethertype
and 'undefined protocol' values.

* ProtocolIndex is an ordinal value that acts as an index into s_protocols
and s_stats.
