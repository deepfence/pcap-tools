IPS actions allow you to execute custom responses to events.
Unlike loggers, these are invoked before thresholding and can be used to
control external agents (including loggers).

IPS rules have an associated type that determines what kind of action they
trigger. The rule types defined in this module are:

* log
* pass
* alert
* drop
* block
* reset

There is also a "none" rule type, which is a no-op.
