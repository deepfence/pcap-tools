This directory contains the implementation of ICMP session tracking and
processing functions.  When the network protocol for a flow is determined
to be ICMP the base Stream preprocessor will delegate handling of the
packets on that flow to this module.

The StreamIcmp class is implemented as a subclass of Inspector and provides
functions for loading stream ICMP configuration and packet evaluation.  The
packet eval method is not used as the base Stream Inspector delegates
packets directly to the ICMP session packet processing method.

Currently only the ICMP Unreachable message is handled by the ICMP session
module.

The module icmp_ha.cc (and icmp_ha.h) implements the per-protocol hooks into
the stream logic for HA.  IcmpHAManager is a static class that interfaces
to a per-packet thread instance of the class IcmpHA.  IcmpHA is sub-class
of ProtocolHA, declared in the stream/base area.  Thus each protocol
within 'stream' can have specific HA logic and interfaces.

IcmpHAManager::process_deletion() is called when an ICMP stream is being 
destroyed and indicates to the stream & flow HA logic that a flow
deletion HA message needs to be emitted for the flow in question.
Icmp streams are closed due to timeout or puning actions which lead
to the invocation of process_deletion().

IcmpHA::create_session() is called from the stream & flow HA logic and
handles the creation of new flow upon receiving an HA update message.
