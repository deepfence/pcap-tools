This directory contains the implementation of the Stream File flow tracking
and processing functions.  When the source for a flow is a file the base
Stream preprocessor delegates handling of the packets on that flow to this
module.

The StreamFile class is implemented as a subclass of Inspector and provides
functions for loading stream file configuration and packet evaluation.  The
packet eval method is not used as the base Stream Inspector delegates
packets directly to the file session packet processing method.

The file session packet processing function in turn delegates processing of
the packet to the file_processing method of the FileAPI class.
