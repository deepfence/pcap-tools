Templates and helpers for interfacing with luajit virtual machines are here:

* *State* is a RAII wrapper to the lua_State* pointer
* *ManageStack* prevents the stack from growing too large and ensures that
  the stack has enough room.
* *Args* provides type checking access to the lua stack from within an
  embedded C/C\++ function
* *lua_iface.h* contains wrappers for exposing C\++ objects to lua
* *lua_ref.h* provides a very basic reference tracking system to prevent
  Lua from garbage collecting objects that may be in use but are otherwise
  untracked in the lua vm.
* *lua_stack.h* provides templated functions to interface with the stack
