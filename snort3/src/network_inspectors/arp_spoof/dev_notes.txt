Implement a specialized inspection tool which locates and alerts on ARP
protocol violations.  This network inspector looks at all ARP ethernet
frames and attempts to locate ARP spoofing attacks.

It alerts on source or destination address mismatch.  It also alerts on an
ARP request ocuring on a uni-cast frame (needs to be multi-cast).

A network inspector module as it needs to examine all ethernet frames with
packet type of ARP.
