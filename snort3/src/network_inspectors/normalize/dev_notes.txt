Implement a large group of packet normalizations.  See normalize.h for the
entire set.  If enabled/configured, examine each packet and make required
modifications.

The primary utility is to 'repair' protocol issues and provide a cleaner
packet to the downstream network.  This ensures that packets that Snort
passes have the best likelihood of reaching their destination since
otherwise attackers could craft packets that facilitate evasions.  The
normalizations are done before any related inspection and detection by
Snort.

Process IP4, IP6, ICMP4, ICMP6, and TCP protocols.  No UDP nor Ethernet
level normalizations currently exist.

Maintain activity counts and print these counts as part of the Snort exit
(or on-demain) counts.

If inline and able to perform packet replacement, replace the normalized
packet in the output stream.

Note that TCP stream normalizations are done within the stream_tcp module.
The configuration is done together with the above normalizations, however.
