Connectors house the collection of the plugin-type Connector.  As defined
.../framework/connector.h, the Connector object implements a simplex
communications channel that is in-turn used by SideChannel objects.

Connectors have the standard plugin api and instantiation/destruction protocols.

The file_connector writes messages to a file and reads messages from a file.

Configuration entries map side channels to connector instances.
