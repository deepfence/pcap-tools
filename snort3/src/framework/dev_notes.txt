This directory provides base classes and support for the various Snort++
plugins.  Module provides an abstracted interface to the common plugin
features such as configuration.  Module corresponds to a top-level Lua
table of the same name.

Note that plugins must keep configuration (parse time) separate from state
(run time).  A plugin must store its state on the flow in FlowData or in
thread local data.  In some cases thread local data is handled by an array
attached to configuration with one element per packet thread, however those
cases are rare and should only be needed by the framework code, not the
plugins.

PacketConstraints allow you to match packets and flows against a 5-tuple.
