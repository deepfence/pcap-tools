// this file defines API_OPTIONS.

// API_OPTIONS is also defined in config.h for building Snort++ but that
// file is not installed.  api_options.h will be included automatically by
// base_api.h when building external plugins from the installed headers.

// the purpose of this define is to detect incompatibility between Snort
// and dynamic plugins that may have been built with different features.

// this applies to conditionally defined member data in shared structs.  it
// does not apply to conditionally defined functions since those prevent
// loading (that should be true for virtuals as well).

// for example, suppose we had this:
// 
// struct SnortConfig
// {
//     // some member data
// #ifdef FOO
//     // optional member data
// #endif
//     // more member data
// };

// and then we did this:
// 
// 1.  build and install snort with build option set A.
// 2.  build and install external plugins.  These use A and are compatible.
// 3.  build and install snort with build option set B (changing FOO).
// 4.  run snort with B options and load external plugins with A options.

// these are incompatible and will be caught upon loading instead of trying
// to run with mismatched structs and crashing in possibly mysterious ways.
// note that the api version of snort and plugins must match exactly.  api
// version is orthogonal to build.

// features like FOO require special handling in configure.ac and
// config.cmake.h.in to make this work.  see those files for details.

// finally, features like FOO should be avoided and have so far been
// eliminated from Snort++.  however, they have plagued Snort 2.X so this
// facility is provided just in case.
