Payload injector is a utility class intended to help other Snort components with
application-protocol-level injection. The calling components decide when and
what to inject. Payload injector is responsible for flow-control concerns such
as transmitting RST flags to endpoints as well as blocking flows within Snort.
It coordinates with the Active component of Snort to perform these functions.

Currently it is being used for HTTP/1 injections. HTTP/2 support is in developement.
