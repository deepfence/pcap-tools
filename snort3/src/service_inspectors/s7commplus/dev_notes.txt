S7comm (S7 Communication)and S7commplus are Siemens proprietary protocols that
runs between programmable logic controllers (PLCs) of the Siemens S7-300/400 
and S7-1500/1200(v4.0) families, typically on TCP port 102.

It is used for PLC programming, exchanging data between PLCs, accessing PLC 
data from SCADA systems and diagnostic purposes. The S7CommPlus protocol is
a new version of the original S7Comm protocol.

The S7comm and S7commplus data comes as payload of COTP data packets. The first 
byte is 0x32 for S7comm and 0x72 for S7commplus as protocol identifiers. The same 
inspector will be used for both protocols, although currently only S7commplus is 
supported.

The S7Commplus inspector decodes the S7Commplus protocol and provides rule options
to access certain protocol fields and Data content. This allows the user to write 
rules for S7commplus packets without decoding the protocol.
