This directory contains all files related to IMAP protocol processing.  The
protocol aware flushing for IMAP determines IMAP PDU and this reassembled
IMAP PDU is processed by the IMAP inspector. Both IMAP requests/responses
are parsed and the MIME attachments in IMAP responses are processed using
the file API. The file API extracts and decodes the attachments. file_data
is then set to the start of these extracted/decoded attachments. This
inspector also identifies and whitelists the IMAPS traffic.
