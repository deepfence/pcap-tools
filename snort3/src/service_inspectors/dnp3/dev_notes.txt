This directory contains all the files related to DNP3 protocol processing.

DNP3 is supported over both TCP/IP and UDP. The inspector provides anomaly
detection and IPS rule options for matching on data, functions, indications
and objects in the messages.

The protocol aware flushing (PAF) for DNP3 identifies and flushes frames at
link layer. The reassembly code in dnp3_reassembly.cc handles transport layer 
reassembly and generates application layer PDUs for inspection.
For the UDP case, packets do not go through PAF and the inspector handles
link layer decoding. Since there can be multiple application level PDUs in a 
single UDP packet, the inspector performs detection as well.

Configuration of ports is handled by the binder. The default server port is
20000. The only other DNP3 specific configuration is CRC check enable/disable
