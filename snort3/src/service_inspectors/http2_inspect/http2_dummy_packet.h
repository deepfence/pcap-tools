/*
 * The purpose of this Packet subclass is to enable H2I to take direction from http_inspect on
 * whether or not to send a frame to detection. When http_inspect is processing normal HTTP/1.1
 * traffic it is dealing with a real packet that has a context, the field on which disable_all()
 * is called to disable detection on that packet. With HTTP/2 traffic, http_inspect is processing a
 * dummy packet that H2I created, which does not contain a context object. Rather than create an
 * entire new context object when we really only need a bool, http_inspect checks if the flow is
 * HTTP/2 and sets a bool instead of calling it's usual disable_all(). H2I checks the bool and can
 * then call disable_all() on the real packet.
