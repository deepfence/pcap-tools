This directory contains all files related to RPC Decode inspector.

RPC Decode inspector normalizes the RPC requests from remote machines by
converting all fragments into one continuous stream. This is very useful
for doing things like defeating hostile attackers trying to stealth
themselves from IDS by fragmenting the request so the string 0186A0 is
broken up. RPC Decode will alert when multiple queries are in a given
packet, when a complete query exceeds the packet size.
