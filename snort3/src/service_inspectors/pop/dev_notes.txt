This directory contains all files related to POP protocol processing.

The protocol aware flushing for POP determines POP PDU and this reassembled
POP PDU is processed by the POP inspector. Both POP commands/responses are
parsed and the MIME attachments in POP responses are processed using the
file API.  The file API extracts and decodes the attachments. file_data is
then set to the start of these extracted/decoded attachments. This
inspector also identifies and whitelists the POPS traffic.
