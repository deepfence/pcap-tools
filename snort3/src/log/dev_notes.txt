Text output logging facilities are located here:

* log - provides convenience functions for global packet logging.

* log_text - provides convenience functions for logging with a TextLog.

* messages - provides Dumper class and message logging facilities.

  Class ConfigLogger is implemented to provide functions to format
  config verbose output from Inspector::show().

* obfuscator - provides an API for logging packets w/o revealing sensitive
  data.

  class Obfuscator is implemented with a std::set to provide in order
  access for pottentialy out-of-order insertions.

  Currently does not support streaming mode.  It should be possible to
  iterate over contiguous chunks of data, alternating between obfuscated
  and plain.

* text_log - provides a class like implementation (TextLog) for multiple
  instances of text-based log files.
