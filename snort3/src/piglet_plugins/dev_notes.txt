This directory contains subclasses of Piglet::BasePlugin that correspond to
each Snort plugin type. Each pp_\*.cc source file is a Snort plugin proper.

piglet_plugins_common contains utilities for working with the Lua C API and
Lua interfaces for some useful Snort data structures (Packet, DecodeData).
There is also an interface called RawBuffer.  This is essentially a wrapper
around a std::string.
