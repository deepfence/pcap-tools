/***
 * This file contains functions to generate hashes used keyed hash functions.
 * Keyed hash functions make it difficult/impossible to find information about the
 * output of a hash when the key is unknown to the attacker. This fact holds, even
 * when the input value is known.
 *
 * We use these kinds of hashes heavily internally - e.g. for scriptland hash generation.
 * It is important that these hashes are not easily guessable to prevent complexity attacks.
 *
 * The HashKey class is the actual class that is used to generate Hash keys that are used internally,
 * e.g. for lookups in hash-tables; the Hashes are also used for connection ID generation.
 *
 * This means that the hashes created by most functions in this file will be different each run, unless
 * a seed file is used. There are a few functions that create hashes that are static over runs
 * and use an installation-wide seed value; these are specifically called out.
