## Generated for UDP packets to pass on their payload. As the number of UDP
## packets can be very large, this event is normally raised only for those on
## ports configured in :zeek:id:`udp_content_delivery_ports_orig` (for packets
## sent by the flow's originator) or :zeek:id:`udp_content_delivery_ports_resp`
## (for packets sent by the flow's responder). However, delivery can be enabled
## for all UDP request and reply packets by setting
## :zeek:id:`udp_content_deliver_all_orig` or
## :zeek:id:`udp_content_deliver_all_resp`, respectively. Note that this
## event is also raised for all matching UDP packets, including empty ones.
##
## u: The connection record for the corresponding UDP flow.
##
## is_orig: True if the event is raised for the originator side.
