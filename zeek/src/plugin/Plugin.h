 *   protocols (RPC, NFS, etc.), each of which would be a separate component.
 *   Likewise, an SQLite plugin could provide both a writer and reader

 *
 * - Provide BiF elements (functions, events, types, globals). Typically
 *   they'll be defined in *.bif files, but a plugin can also create them
 *   internally.
 *
 * - Provide hooks (aka callbacks) into Bro's core processing to inject
 *   and/or alter functionality.
 *
 * A plugin needs to explicitly register all the functionality it provides.
 * For components, it needs to call AddComponent(); for BiFs AddBifItem();
 * and for hooks EnableHook() and then also implement the corresponding
