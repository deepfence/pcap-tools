##! This is an example script that demonstrates Zeekygen-style
##! documentation.  It generally will make most sense when viewing
##! the script's raw source code and comparing to the HTML-rendered
##! version.
##!
##! Comments in the from ``##!`` are meant to summarize the script's
##! purpose.  They are transferred directly in to the generated
##! `reStructuredText <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_
##! (reST) document associated with the script.
##!
##! .. tip:: You can embed directives and roles within ``##``-stylized comments.
##!
##! There's also a custom role to reference any identifier node in
##! the Zeek Sphinx domain that's good for "see alsos", e.g.
##!
##! See also: :zeek:see:`ZeekygenExample::a_var`,
##! :zeek:see:`ZeekygenExample::ONE`, :zeek:see:`SSH::Info`
##!
##! And a custom directive does the equivalent references:
##!
##! .. zeek:see:: ZeekygenExample::a_var ZeekygenExample::ONE SSH::Info

# Comments that use a single pound sign (#) are not significant to
# a script's auto-generated documentation, but ones that use a
# double pound sign (##) do matter.  In some cases, like record
# field comments, it's necessary to disambiguate the field with
# which a comment associates: e.g. "##<" can be used on the same line
# as a field to signify the comment relates to it and not the
# following field. "##<" can also be used more generally in any
# variable declarations to associate with the last-declared identifier.
#
# Generally, the auto-doc comments (##) are associated with the
# next declaration/identifier found in the script, but Zeekygen
# will track/render identifiers regardless of whether they have any
# of these special comments associated with them.
#
# The first sentence contained within the "##"-stylized comments for
# a given identifier is special in that it will be used as summary
# text in a table containing all such identifiers and short summaries.
# If there are no sentences (text terminated with '.'), then everything
# in the "##"-stylized comments up until the first empty comment
# is taken as the summary text for a given identifier.

# @load directives are self-documenting, don't use any ``##`` style
# comments with them.
@load base/frameworks/notice
@load base/protocols/http
@load frameworks/software/vulnerable

# "module" statements are self-documenting, don't use any ``##`` style
# comments with them.

# more information can be supplied in two different ways.

	Zeekygen_Four,  ##< it's probably best to use only one style consistently.
