##! This script logs evidence regarding the degree to which the packet
##! capture process suffers from measurement loss.  
##! The loss could be due to overload on the host or NIC performing 
##! the packet capture or it could even be beyond the host.  If you are 
##! capturing from a switch with a SPAN port, it's very possible that 
##! the switch itself could be overloaded and dropping packets.
##! Reported loss is computed in terms of the number of "gap events" (ACKs 
##! for a sequence number that's above a gap).
