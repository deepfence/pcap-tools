##! This script logs and tracks active services.  For this script, an active
##! service is defined as an IP address and port of a server for which
##! a TCP handshake (SYN+ACK) is observed, assumed to have been done in the
##! past (started seeing packets mid-connection, but the server is actively
##! sending data), or sent at least one UDP packet.
##! If a protocol name is found/known for service, that will be logged,
##! but services whose names can't be determined are also still logged.
