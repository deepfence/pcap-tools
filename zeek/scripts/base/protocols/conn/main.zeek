##! This script manages the tracking/logging of general information regarding
##! TCP, UDP, and ICMP traffic.  For UDP and ICMP, "connections" are to
##! be interpreted using flow semantics (sequence of packets from a source
##! host/port to a destination host/port).  Further, ICMP "ports" are to
##! be interpreted as the source port meaning the ICMP message type and
##! the destination port being the ICMP message code.

		## * RSTRH: Responder sent a SYN ACK followed by a RST, we never saw a

		##
		## * SH: Originator sent a SYN followed by a FIN, we never saw a

		##
		## * SHR: Responder sent a SYN ACK followed by a FIN, we never saw a
		##   SYN from the originator.
		##
		## * OTH: No SYN seen, just midstream traffic (a "partial connection"
		##   that was not later closed).

		## if the associated sequence number differs from the
