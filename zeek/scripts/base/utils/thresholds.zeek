##! Functions for using multiple thresholds with a counting tracker.  For
##! example, you may want to generate a notice when something happens 10 times
##! and again when it happens 100 times but nothing in between.  You can use
##! the :zeek:id:`check_threshold` function to define your threshold points
##! and the :zeek:type:`TrackCount` variable where you are keeping track of your
##! counter.

export {
	type TrackCount: record {
		## The counter for the number of times something has happened.
		n:     count &default=0;
		## The index of the vector where the counter currently is.  This
		## is used to track which threshold is currently being watched
		## for.
		index: count &default=0;
