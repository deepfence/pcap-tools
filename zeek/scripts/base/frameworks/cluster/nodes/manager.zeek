##! This is the core Zeek script to support the notion of a cluster manager.
##!
##! The manager is passive (the workers connect to us), and once connected
##! the manager registers for the events on the workers that are needed
##! to get the desired data from the workers.  This script will be 
##! automatically loaded if necessary based on the type of node being started.

##! This is where the cluster manager sets it's specific settings for other
##! frameworks and in the core.
