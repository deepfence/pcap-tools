##! This script handles the tracking/logging of tunnels (e.g. Teredo,
##! AYIYA, or IP-in-IP such as 6to4 where "IP" is either IPv4 or IPv6).
##!
##! For any connection that occurs over a tunnel, information about its
##! encapsulating tunnels is also found in the *tunnel* field of
##! :zeek:type:`connection`.
