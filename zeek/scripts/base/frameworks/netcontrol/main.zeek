##! Zeek's NetControl framework.
##!
##! This plugin-based framework allows to control the traffic that Zeek monitors
##! as well as, if having access to the forwarding path, the traffic the network
##! forwards. By default, the framework lets everything through, to both Zeek
##! itself as well as on the network. Scripts can then add rules to impose
##! restrictions on entities, such as specific connections or IP addresses.
##!
##! This framework has two APIs: a high-level and low-level. The high-level API
##! provides convenience functions for a set of common operations. The
##! low-level API provides full flexibility.
