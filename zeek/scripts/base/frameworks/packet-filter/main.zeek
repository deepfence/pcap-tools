##! This script supports how Zeek sets its BPF capture filter.  By default
##! Zeek sets a capture filter that allows all traffic.  If a filter
##! is set on the command line, that filter takes precedence over the default
##! open filter and all filters defined in Zeek scripts with the
##! :zeek:id:`capture_filters` and :zeek:id:`restrict_filters` variables.
