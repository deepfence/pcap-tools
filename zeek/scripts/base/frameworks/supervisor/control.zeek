##! The Zeek process supervision (remote) control API.  This defines a Broker topic
##! prefix and events that can be used to control an external Zeek supervisor process.
##! This API was introduced in Zeek 3.1.0 and considered unstable until 4.0.0.
##! That is, it may change in various incompatible ways without warning or
##! deprecation until the stable 4.0.0 release.
