# This is a trace that uses a completely non-standard way of establishing TLS 1.3; this seems
# to be an undocumented extension where the TLS version is negotiated via the server sending back
# an supported_versions extension (which, according to the RFC is strictly prohibited).
#
# This only seems to happen with Chrome talking to google servers. We do not recognize this as
# TLS 1.3, but we do not abort when encountering traffic like this.
#
# In the meantime this way of establishing TLS 1.3 was standardized. Still keeping the test even
# though we parse this correctly now.
