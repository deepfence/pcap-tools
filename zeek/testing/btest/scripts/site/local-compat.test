# @TEST-EXEC: zeek local-`cat $DIST/VERSION | sed 's/\([0-9].[0-9]\).*/\1/g'`.zeek

# This tests the compatibility of the past release's site/local.zeek
# script with the current version of Zeek.
#
# If the test fails because it doesn't find the right file (e.g. you just
# made a release), that just means you should replace the contents of this
# test with the contents of site/local.zeek from the last release.  Use
# a new local-X.Y.zeek name just so this test is forced to be periodically
# refreshed with the new contents of local.zeek after every release.
#
# If the test fails while loading the old local-X.Y.zeek, it usually
# indicates a note will need to be made in NEWS explaining to users
# how to migrate to the new version.  After adding that note to NEWS,
# # simply update this test's TEST-START-FILE with the latest contents
# site/local.zeek.
