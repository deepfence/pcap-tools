# This check piggy-backs on the test-all-policy.zeek test, assuming that every
# loadable script is referenced there.  The only additional check here is
# that the zeekygen package should even load scripts that are commented
# out in test-all-policy.zeek because the zeekygen package is only loaded
# when generated documentation and will terminate has soon as zeek_init
# is handled, even if a script will e.g. put Zeek into listen mode or otherwise
# cause it to not terminate after scripts are parsed.

# @TEST-EXEC: bash %INPUT $DIST/scripts/test-all-policy.zeek $DIST/scripts/zeekygen/__load__.zeek
