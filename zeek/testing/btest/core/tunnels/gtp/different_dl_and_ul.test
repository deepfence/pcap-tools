# Uplink GTP tunnel uses src port 5906 and dst port 2152.
# One side on port 2152 qualifies for GTP user plane.
# The Downlink GTP tunnel uses port 2152 for both src and dst.
# (checksums are incorrect because packets were anonymized and tcprewrite
# seems to fail to correct the checksums when there's IP fragmentation).
