FTP INSTRUCTIONS

Most NCSA Software is released into the public domain.  That is, for these 
programs, the public domain has all rights for future licensing, resale, 
and publication of available packages. If you are connected to Internet
(NSFNET, ARPANET, MILNET, etc) you may download NCSA software and documentation and source code if it is available, at no charge from the anonymous file 
transfer protocol (FTP) server at NCSA where you got this file. The procedure
you should follow to do so is presented  below. If you have any questions
regarding this procedure or whether you are connected to Internet, consult your local system administration or network expert.

1. Log on to a host at your site that is connected to the Internet and is
   running software supporting the FTP command.

2. Invoke FTP on most systems by entering the Internet address of the server.
   Type the following at the shell (usually "%") prompt:

      % ftp ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu

3. Log in by entering anonymous for the name.

4. Enter your local email address (login@host) for the password.

5. Enter the following at the "ftp>" prompt to copy a text file from our 
   server to your local host:

      ftp> get filename

   where "filename" is the name of the file you want a copy of.  For example,
   to get a copy of this file from the server enter:

      ftp> get README.FIRST

   To get a copy of our software brochure, enter:

      ftp> cd ncsapubs
	   get TechResCatalog 

   NOTE:  Some of the filenames on the server are rather long to aid in
          identification.  Some operating systems may have problems with names
          this long.  To change the name the file will have on your local
          machine type the following at the "ftp>" prompt ("remoteName" is the
          name of the file on the server and "localName" is the name you want
          the file to have on your local machine):

             ftp> get remoteName localName

          Example:

             ftp> get TechResCatalog catalog.txt


6. For files that are not text files (almost everything else) you will need to
   specify that you want to transfer binary files.  Do this by ty
