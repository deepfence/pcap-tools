This directory contains suites for testing for Zeek's correct
operation:

    btest/
        An ever-growing set of small unit tests testing Zeek's
        functionality.

    external/
        A framework for downloading additional test sets that run more
        complex Zeek configuration on larger traces files. Due to their
        size, these are not included directly. See the README for more
        information. 

    scripts/
        Helpers scripts used by some tests.
