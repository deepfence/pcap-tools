=================================
The Zeek Network Security Monitor
=================================

Zeek is a powerful framework for network traffic analysis and security
monitoring. Follow us on Twitter at @zeekurity.

Key Features
============

*   **In-depth Analysis**
    Zeek ships with analyzers for many protocols, enabling
    high-level semantic analysis at the application layer.

*   **Adaptable & Flexible**
    Zeek's domain specific scripting language enables site-specific
    monitoring policies and means that it is not restricted to any
    particular detection approach.

*   **Efficient**
    Zeek targets high-performance networks and is used operationally
    at a variety of large sites.

*   **Highly Stateful**
    Zeek keeps extensive application-layer state about the network
    it monitors and provides a high-level archive of a network's
    activity.

Getting Started

stable releases, tutorials on getting Zeek set up, and many other
useful resources.

You can find release notes in NEWS, and a complete record of all
changes in CHANGES.

To work with the most recent code from the development branch of Zeek,

        {
        print "Hello, World!";
        }

And run it:
