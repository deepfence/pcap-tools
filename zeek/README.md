Key Features
--------------

* __In-depth Analysis__
	Zeek ships with analyzers for many protocols, enabling high-level semantic
  analysis at the application layer.

* __Adaptable and Flexible__
	Zeek's domain-specific scripting language enables site-specific monitoring
  policies and means that it is not restricted to any particular detection
  approach.

* __Efficient__
	Zeek targets high-performance networks and is used operationally at a variety
  of large sites.

* __Highly Stateful__
	Zeek keeps extensive application-layer state about the network it monitors
  and provides a high-level archive of a network's activity.
