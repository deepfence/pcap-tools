This is an example of how to build a Wireshark plugin out-of-tree.

Note that this builds against Wireshark's *installed* version. You should of
course adapt to your own needs.

To build/install the plugin:

$ mkdir build && cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
$ sudo make install

If your WiresharkConfig.cmake file is not in one of the standard cmake search
paths you will have to tell cmake where to find it. You can do so using
CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH, for example

$ cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH="/opt/wireshark" ..
