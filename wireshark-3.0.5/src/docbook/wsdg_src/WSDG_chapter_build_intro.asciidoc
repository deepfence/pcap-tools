[[ChCodeGLib]]

=== The GLib library

GLib is used as a basic platform abstraction library. It doesn't provide
any direct GUI functionality.

To quote the GLib Reference Manual:
____
GLib provides the core application building blocks for libraries and
applications written in C. It provides the core object system used in GNOME, the
main loop implementation, and a large set of utility functions for strings and
common data structures.
____

GLib contains lots of useful things for platform independent development.
See https://developer.gnome.org/glib/[] for details about GLib.
