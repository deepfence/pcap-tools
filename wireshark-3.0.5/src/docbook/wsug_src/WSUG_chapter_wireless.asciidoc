[[ChWirelessWLANTraffic]]

=== WLAN Traffic

Statistics about captured WLAN traffic. This can be found under the
menu:Wireless[] menu and summarizes the wireless network traffic found
in the capture. Probe requests will be merged into an existing network
if the SSID matches.

.The “WLAN Traffic Statistics” window
image::wsug_graphics/ws-stats-wlan-traffic.png[{screenshot-attrs}]

Each row in the list shows the statistical values for exactly one wireless
network.

_Name resolution_ will be done if selected in the window and if it is active for
the MAC layer.

_Only show existing networks_ will exclude probe requests with a SSID not
matching any network from the list.

The btn:[Copy] button will copy the list values to the clipboard in CSV (Comma
Separated Values) format.


[TIP]
====
This window will be updated frequently, so it will be useful, even if you open
it before (or while) you are doing a live capture.
