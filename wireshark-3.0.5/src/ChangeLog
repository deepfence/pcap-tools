    Fix build with non-standard install prefix
    
    The variables BUILD_dumpcap and PCAP_FOUND are defined after the if
    condition, therefore wireshark is built with a relative RPATH and
    library loading for privileged processes fails with glibc.
    
    Move the definition of BUILD_dumpcap before it is used and drop
    the test for PCAP_FOUND.
    
    Move a comment to the proper line while at it.

    NSIS: Tell the user to uninstall Npcap 0.99[45] manually.
    
    Npcap 0.994 and 0.995 might crash the system while being removed. Later
    versions of the installer warn about this, but a MessageBox doesn't
    provide much space to describe what's going on.
    
    Add manual uninstallation instructions to the release notes.
    
    If we find a problematic version of Npcap in the NSIS installer, tell
    the user that they should uninstall it manually. Link to the relevant
    section in the release notes.

    dot11crypt: Fix crash on failure finding GTK in decrypted frame
    
    If GTK cannot be found inside a successfully decrypted wireless frame
    the dot11crypt engine returns incorrect decrypted data length of 0
    bytes. As the IEEE802.11 dissector does not check the length of the
    decrypted frame the number of bytes allocated and copied to wmem ends
    up being a negative number (i.e. a huge unsigned number). This results
    in a SIGSEGV crash while copying data.
    
    Fix this both by returning a correct length from dot11crypt engine
    and add extra an protection to the IEEE802.11 dissector if the length
    for any (other) reason still would end up being a negative number.

    When there is a problem with output pipe, randpktdump will call
    cfile_write_failure_message() which in turn calls cmdarg_err() which
    calls print_err. Call cmdarg_err_init() so print_err is not NULL.

    SNMP: handle Net-SNMP Engine Id of 12 octets
    
    The Net-SNMP code creates an Engine Id size based on the compilation
    size, either 8 or 12 octets long. Current implementation handles 32 bit
    compilation of Net-SNMP (resulting in 8 octets), this change adds
    handling of 64 bit compilation of Net-SNMP (resulting in 12 octets).
