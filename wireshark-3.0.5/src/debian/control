  * "snoop"
  * "iptrace"
  * Sniffer Basic (NetXRay)/Windows Sniffer Pro
  * RADCOM WAN/LAN Analyzers
  * Lucent/Ascend access products
  * HP-UX nettl
  * Toshiba ISDN Router
  * ISDN4BSD "i4btrace" utility
  * Cisco Secure Intrusion Detection System iplogging facility
  * pppd logs (pppdump-format files)
  * VMS TCPTRACE
