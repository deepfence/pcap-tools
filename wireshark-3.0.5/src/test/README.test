Wireshark Tests

The recommended steps to prepare for and to run tests:

* Install two Python packages, pytest: `pip install pytest pytest-xdist`
* Build programs (“wireshark”, “tshark”, etc.): `ninja`
* Build additional programs for the “unittests” suite: `ninja test-programs`
* Run tests in the build directory: `pytest`

Replace `ninja test-programs` by `make test-programs` as needed.
