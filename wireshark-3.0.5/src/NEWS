Wireshark 3.0.5 Release Notes

 What is Wireshark?

  Wireshark is the world’s most popular network protocol analyzer. It is
  used for troubleshooting, analysis, development and education.

 What’s New

  The Windows installers now ship with Qt 5.12.5. They previously
  shipped with Qt 5.12.4.

  If you have Npcap 0.994 or 0.995 installed, your system might crash
  when upgrading. We recommend that you uninstall these versions
  manually prior to installing Wireshark. See Npcap bugs 1591[1] and
  1675[2] for more details. You can uninstall either version manually by
  doing the following:

   1. Open a command or PowerShell prompt as Administrator and run
      sc.exe config npcap start=disabled.

   2. Run sc.exe config npf start=disabled. This will fail if WinPcap
      compatibility mode isn’t enabled, but is otherwise harmless.

   3. Reboot (optional).

   4. Open “Programs and Features” in the Control Panel or “Apps &
      features” in Settings and uninstall Npcap.

   5. Open “Device Manager” (devmgmt.msc) in the Control Panel and
      expand the “Network adapters” section. Uninstall each “Npcap
      Loopback Adapter” that you find.
